### Tools developed:

- **[QR Code Decoder](https://robinzor.nl/qr)**: A user-friendly tool for decoding QR codes, operating entirely in your browser for maximum privacy.

- **[Hasher](https://robinzor.nl/hash)**: Perform integrity checks with ease. This tool supports file hash generation, including the advanced SSDEEP algorithm, without any server-side processing.

### Privacy first:
Both tools are designed with privacy in mind, processing data locally in your browser and not making any external requests.
